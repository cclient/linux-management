This will start an instance of the Python interpreter and load in your project’s settings for you. You can then interact with the models. The following terminal session demonstrates this functionality. Check out the inline commentary to see what each command does.

# Import the Category model from the Rango application
>>> from rango.models import Category

# Show all the current categories
>>> print Category.objects.all()
[] # Returns an empty list (no categories have been defined!)

# Create a new category object, and save it to the database.
>>> c = Category(name="Test")
>>> c.save()

# Now list all the category objects stored once more.
>>> print Category.objects.all()
[<Category: test>] # We now have a category called 'test' saved in the database!

# Quit the Django shell.
>>> quit()
